## Overview

This is an advice generator app using an api

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

- Started with setting the style variables
- Next I did the HTML markup
- After that I did all the styling in CSS and media break points
- Once the markup and styling work was done I did the Javascript functionality, fetching the data from the API and displaying it in the app

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design
- JavaScript
- API

### What I learned

This was very helpful in letting me practice fetching data from an API and displaying that data.

### Continued development

I hope to continue to get better with JavaScript and do progressively more difficult challenges.
